Define the structs for each component category (Motherboard, CPU, RAM, Cooler, Storage, GPU, PowerSupply).

Create vectors to store the components:

motherboards
cpus
rams
coolers
storages
gpus
powerSupplies
Parse the CSV file and populate the component vectors using the parseCSVFile function.

Display a list of available components to the user, allowing them to choose one component from each category:

motherboard
cpu
ram
cooler
storage
gpu
power supply
Check if the selected RAM is compatible with the chosen motherboard using the isRAMCompatible function.

If incompatible, inform the user and prompt them to choose another RAM.
Check if the selected CPU is compatible with the chosen motherboard using the isCPUCompatible function.

If incompatible, inform the user and prompt them to choose another CPU.
Calculate the total wattage of the selected components by summing the wattage of the CPU, cooler, and GPU.

Check if the selected storage is compatible with the chosen motherboard.

Check if the total wattage exceeds the rated wattage range of the selected power supply.

If it exceeds, inform the user that the power supply is not sufficient.
If it is within the range, inform the user that the computer is compatible and can be turned on.
End the program.
